1. VGG16+LSTM(Long short term Memory) -- The features would be extracted for each individual frame which would be then passed to the LSTM network for continuous monitoring for fall detection in the time interval of 3 seconds. (since most of the falls does not extend beyond the 3 seconds).

2. 3D Convolutional Neural Networks -- A 3D convolution would be done on the video frames on which our weight matrices would be trained which then can be used to get a probability of the fall.

3. VGG16+Bidirectional LSTM --  This approach uses VGG16 to extract features from the individual frame of the video, the sequence of frame features are then taken into bidirectional LSTM recurrent networks for detection.

Out of these three, what we see is the 2nd method provides the most accurate predictions of Fall. We will train our network using this method.
