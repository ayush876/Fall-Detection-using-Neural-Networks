# Fall-Detection-using-Neural-Networks


What we aim is to use UP Fall detection Dataset(https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/har-up/) to train our model. We belive achiving accuracy as high as 90% would not be that difficult.


The Data used will be the UP Fall detection only.

For detection using smart watch sensors would be done using Mobi Act Dataset or UP Fall detection dataset both of which provides data on gyroscopes, acclerometers etc.
